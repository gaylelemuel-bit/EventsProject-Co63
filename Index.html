    <p class="about-Speaker">Known as the “Hip Hop Preacher,” Eric Thomas has risen from homelessness and hardship to become one of the world’s most sought-after motivational speakers and educators. His journey began living on the streets of Detroit, where he was homeless for two years before a chance encounter with a preacher changed his trajectory. Thomas went on to earn his Ph.D. in Education Administration from Michigan State University, developing his unique voice on motivation, self-actualization, and academic achievement along the way. Thomas’ credibility stems from his authentic life transformation and the measurable impact of his work with disadvantaged youth, elite athletes, and corporate leaders. His insights come not from theoretical knowledge but from lived experience overcoming poverty, educational struggles, and systemic barriers. This hard-won wisdom gives him uncommon authority when addressing personal transformation and achievement despite obstacles.</p>

    <p class="about-Speaker">Danielle Williams-McCord Playwright, Author, Human Sex Trafficking Survivor and now Pastor are the titles she currently holds, but before Danielle became an anointed woman of God she suffered a series of horrific events; which birthed an astounding testimony. In 2008 Danielle accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as her personal Savior in a New York basement where she was kidnapped and raped repeatedly, but by the grace of God she was able to escape and through that experience she made a vow to God that she would serve him all the days of her life which included telling her story while helping others who share her experiences. Danielle was licensed and ordained as an Evangelist on April 8, 2010. Danielle is the author of three books, “Preaching In Pain”, “Barren” and her first booked titled “From Porn To The Pulpit”, which entails her testimony of hurt, violence, drug addiction, abandonment, abuse, stripping, prostitution and so much more. Her book and now stage play is indeed a memoir, but it is also a guide to the reader of how to journey from victim to victor, from pain to purpose and how to now live a triumphant life through Jesus Christ; all while encouraging her audience to tell their testimony. Never imagining that she’d trust or love again, she was found by her husband and in March of 2014 she married the love of her life Min.Ronald McCord</p>

    <p class="about-Speaker">The worst possible reasons led to Johnny’s placement in a juvenile detention center when he was 12 years old. During his four years there, he witnessed sexual abuse, participated in over 40 fights, and grew even more hardened. Johnny went to federal prison at 17 for assault with a deadly weapon, an adult offense. He was aware that being incarcerated was a different level. After more than eight years, Johnny was released. While in prison, his mother became a Christian. She asked Johnny to drive her to church. There, Johnny met a pastor that God would use to change his life forever. The pastor offered him black bean noodles, not knowing that it was Johnny’s favorite. He shared the good news of Jesus with Johnny and spoke very directly about his need for a Savior. “He talked about emptiness, void, you know, this feeling that I felt,” Johnny recalled. “It was as if he was dissecting my heart and giving me the antidote. It’s almost like a light bulb clicked and it turned on.” Johnny surrendered his life to Jesus. He has now reconnected with his father, who has also become a Christian. “There is hope but it’s not in this world, it’s not in money, it’s not in fame. It’s actually in God alone. And that’s just what I’m here to do, is to shed light on that,” he concluded.</p>

    <p class="about-Speaker">Michael Todd is the co-lead pastor, with his wife Natalie, of Transformation Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the author of the New York Times bestseller Relationship Goals. His latest book is Crazy Faith: It’s Only Crazy Until It Happens (WaterBrook). Our faith is built on something we can’t control or fully understand, and that’s the beautiful thing about it. What our world wants is concrete. We want to know 1 + 1 = 2. But in this fallen world, 1 + 1 can sometimes equal 45. We wonder why bad things happen to people. Why different disasters and injustices are happening everywhere. And God, through all of time, still lovingly asks his children, Will you have faith that I’m in control?</p>
